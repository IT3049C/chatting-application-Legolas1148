## Self-Reflection:
<!-- Write your self-reflection under this line -->
I had some issues with getting some of the methods to work. I misunderstood how async methods are meant to work. But in the end with some assistance from the professor, I was able to get everything done. The javascript for the assignment was mostly easy to understand and write.

### How long it took me to finish this?
It took me about 8 hours to finish this assignment.

## Discussion Questions:
1. What does the bootstrap `display-4` class do?
The display-4 class makes the heading it is assigned to appear as a level 4 heading instead of a level 1 heading from the h1 tag
